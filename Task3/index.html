                    <h2>History of the word search puzzle.</h2>
                    <p>
                    The word search puzzle (also known as WordSeek, WordFind, WonderWord, etc.)
                    was originally designed and published by Norman E. Gibat in the Selenby Digest
                    on March 1, 1968 in Norman, Oklahoma, although the Spanish puzzle creator Pedro
                    Ocón de Oro was publishing "Sopas de letras" (Spanish "Soup of Letters") before
                    that date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Selenby was a small want-ad digest distributed free at Safeway and other stores
                    in the town. The original page size is 8.5 by 5.5 inches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The puzzle was very popular locally and several more followed this original.
                    Some teachers in the Norman schools asked for reprints to use in their classes.
                    One teacher sent them around the country to various friends in other schools.
                    Undoubtedly one of these scattered copies eventually led somebody to sell the idea
                    to a syndicator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Word search puzzles have become very popular on the internet with Facebook games
                    such as Letters of Gold. Other digital and tabletop word search games include A Way
                    with Words, Boggle, Bookworm, Letterpress, Outworded, Puzzlage, Ruzzle, Wonderword,
                    Wordament, WordSpot, Word Streak with Friends, and Word Winder.
