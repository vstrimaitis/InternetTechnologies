                    <h2>The rules of word search puzzles are as follows:</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Pick a word from the list next to the grid of letters</li>
                        <li>Find the word in the grid and cross it out with a line</li>
                        <li>The rules of the "crossing out" are as follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pick a starting cell from the grid</li>
                                <li>Draw a line from the current cell to any neighbouring cell.
                                    Two cells are considered to be neighbours if they share an
                                    edge or a corner.
                                </li>
                                <li>Repeat this process until you reach the last cell.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you take the letters in the order you crossed them out and this
                            sequence matches the word you were searching for, it is considered
                            that you've found the word.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
